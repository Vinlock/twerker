## Why Twerker?

I created Twerker out of necessity. While there are several worker thread libraries available, none of them provided the perfect combination of simplicity, type-safety, and bare-minimum functionality that I was looking for. Most existing solutions were either over-engineered or lacked proper TypeScript support.

Twerker aims to do one thing and do it well: provide a straightforward, type-safe way to run CPU-intensive tasks in worker threads. No bells and whistles, no complex configurations - just a clean API that works out of the box.

## Features

- üì¶ Zero dependencies - uses only Node.js built-in modules
- üöÄ Simple and intuitive API for managing worker threads
- üí™ Fully type-safe with TypeScript
- üîÑ Automatic thread pool management
- üìä Dynamic task queuing and distribution
- üéØ Console output forwarding from workers
- ‚ö° Built for performance with minimal overhead
- üõ°Ô∏è Robust error handling

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add twerker
```

## Quick Start

Create two separate files: one for defining your worker and another for using it. Name your worker file using kebab-case to match the function it implements.

> [!WARNING]
> Always use `createPool()` for running multiple tasks. Do not use `Promise.all()` with multiple `.run()` calls, as this will create a new worker thread for each task, which is inefficient and can overwhelm your system.

### `heavy-computation.ts` - Define your worker
```typescript
import run from 'twerker';

// Define your worker function
const heavyComputation = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  // Simulate CPU-intensive work
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
    result += Math.sqrt(a * b + i);
  }
  return result;
};

// Export the runner directly
export default run(heavyComputation);
```

### `main.ts` - Use the worker
```typescript
import worker from './heavy-computation';

async function main() {
  // Method 1: Run a single task
  const result = await worker.run(10, 20);
  console.log('Single task result:', result);

  // Method 2: Create a pool for multiple tasks
  const pool = worker.createPool(); // Uses number of CPU cores by default
  
  // Queue tasks as needed
  const result1 = await pool.queue(10, 20);
  const result2 = await pool.queue(30, 40);
  const result3 = await pool.queue(50, 60);
  
  console.log('Pool results:', [result1, result2, result3]);

  // Terminate the pool when done
  await pool.terminateWhenDone();
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## API Reference

### `run<TArgs, TReturn>(fn: WorkerFunction<TArgs, TReturn>)`

Creates a worker thread runner for the given function.

Returns an object with:
- `createPool(numWorkers?: number)`: Creates a worker pool with the specified number of workers
- `run(...args: TArgs)`: Runs a single task in a new worker

### `WorkerPool`

The worker pool instance provides:
- `queue(...args: TArgs)`: Queues a task for execution
- `terminateWhenDone()`: Gracefully terminates the pool after completing all tasks

### Error Handling

> [!WARNING]
> If you don't handle worker errors using `handleError()`, any error in the worker will crash your main thread.

```typescript
const pool = createPool();
const task = pool.queue(10, 20).handleError((error) => {
  console.error('Worker failed:', error.message);
  // Handle the error as needed
});
```

## Configuration

The default number of workers is set to the number of CPU cores. You can override this when creating a pool:

```typescript
const pool = createPool(4); // Creates a pool with 4 workers
```

## Best Practices

1. Use worker pools for CPU-intensive tasks that can run in parallel
2. Keep worker functions pure and avoid side effects
3. Terminate pools when they're no longer needed
4. Handle errors appropriately for each task
5. Consider the overhead of data serialization when passing arguments
